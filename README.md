## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I learned how flexbox makes postioning easier. At first I was stuck on how I was going to move my social media icons to the right. Flex-end made it super easy.


```scss
.social {
        margin-right: 4em;
        justify-content: flex-end;
        position: relative;
        top: -5em;
    }
```


If you want more help with flexbox, check out [The Flexbox Guide](https://byteiota.com/flexbox-conatiner/) to learn more.



### Continued development

I'm improving in my skills when it comes to flexbox. I want to keep practicing with different kinds of flexbox and positioning. 

I also need to continue with trying to ind ways to simplify my codes. I tend to overcomplicates this, but I had some control this time. 

### Useful resources

- [Icons](https://iconscout.com/) - I always get my icons from here. You even have to option to change the color. 
- [Flexbox Guide](https://byteiota.com/flexbox-conatiner/) - This is was a life savor for me. I like the visuals so that I know which one I want to use.
